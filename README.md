# Codenames (Replication)

A replication of the card game Codenames, designed by Vlaada Chvátil and published by Czech Games Edition.
All credits for images, color palette, designs and other assets to Vlaada Chvátil and Czech Games Edition.
Please visit https://codenames.game/ for the official app, and https://czechgames.com/ to see their other games.
This project is only a reproduction of the game and meant for ReactJS development experience and not for distribution or profit.
I am in no way associated with Codenames or Czech Games Edition, I just love the game.
